1. System Prompt Hardening:
   - Explicitly forbid discussing, revealing, or acknowledging system instructions
   - Add specific counters to common attack types (role-play, hypotheticals, etc.)
   - Include instructions to detect and reject attempts to redefine identity or purpose

2. Input Sanitization:
   - Implement pattern matching to detect common attack phrases
   - Look for encoded content, unusual character sequences, or formatting tricks
   - Check for attempts to use markdown or code blocks to confuse context boundaries

3. Response Filtering:
   - Verify outputs don't contain sensitive information before returning them
   - Add guardrails that detect when responses might be providing harmful information
   - Implement multi-stage verification for potentially risky responses

4. Model Configuration:
   - Use lower temperature settings for more predictable, conservative responses
   - Set appropriate token limits to prevent lengthy responses that might contain unwanted information
   - Consider using additional classification models to pre-screen requests

5. Operational Security:
   - Regularly update your system prompt based on new attack techniques
   - Monitor and log interactions to identify potential attack patterns
   - Develop an incident response plan for when attacks are successful
